# Password Security Project

## 📌 Overview
The Password Security Project is a Python-based application designed to evaluate and validate password strength using standard security best practices. It helps users identify weak passwords and encourages the use of strong, secure credentials by analyzing factors such as length, complexity, and character diversity.

This project demonstrates practical cybersecurity concepts and secure authentication principles commonly used in real-world systems.
